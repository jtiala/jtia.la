# 👨🏼‍💻 jtia.la

[![Actions Status][actions-status-badge]][actions-status]

[jtia.la][link] is my personal website. It's built with [Hugo][hugo] and the layout is based on [m10c theme][m10c].

## Running locally

1. [Install Hugo][hugo-install]
2. Run Hugo server with drafts enabled:

   ```bash
   hugo server -D
   ```

3. The site should now be available at [localhost:1313][localhost]
